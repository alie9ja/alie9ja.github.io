So my quest for the perfect blogging platform continues.

And it's brought me here. Very interesting, so far. I already have a fully-functioning Squarespace site I've been maintaining for two years. And I am happy with the result. It's polished and slick, for very little work on my end. I like how full-featured it is and how modular everything is. However, I find the act of writing / creating something lacking. The blogging end of it is pretty slow and laggy which hinders my thought process. I don't like that. It creates a barrier which, based on how far and few in between my posts are, obviously discourages me from creating. 

I created my Squarespace site as: #1, a repository for all my advertising work, and #2, a place where I can maintain a personal blog. It has served its purpose well. Hey, I'm paying $100++ a year for the damn thing. I just feel like I need to try some of the other stuff out there. 

I definitely don't want to create another Wordpress site. How many Wordpress accounts have I made through the years? There's just something about it I don't really like that I can't quite put my finger on. Part of it's aesthetic. There's something about the way it looks that I don't find appealing. When it comes to the stuff I use, any stuff, anything, how it looks is as important to me as what it does. It just is. It makes me want to use whatever it is more if I find it visually appealing. Plus, I already use Wordpress at work and I don't want to be reminded of work while I'm doing my own thing.

I also don't like Blogger. I find its vibe old, its interface clunky, and visually unattractive.

Posthaven seems nice. For just five bucks a month, I get a blog that will be around "forever" (though I'm kinda iffy about that claim of theirs) and easy to use. I haven't tried it yet, so you might say, "Then how did you know it's gonna be easy to use?"
